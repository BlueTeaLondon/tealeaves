## Styling

The default styling of Tealeaves is built using TailwindCSS. It comes with a number of
pre-built UI components, but everything can be customised. Each new project is setup
with PostCSS as well as TailwindCSS, all of which can be configured with the following
two files

- postcss.config.js
- tailwind.config.js

Please see the documentation for these two projects for more information
